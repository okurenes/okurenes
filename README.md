# Enes Okur

Automation-focused Software Engineer with strong experience in **e-commerce operations, Python-based process automation, and QA-aware system design**.

I specialize in transforming manual, error-prone operational workflows into **scalable, validated, and sustainable automation pipelines**. My background combines hands-on automation development with **process analysis, data validation, and software testing discipline**, enabling me to build systems that are not only fast, but reliable and maintainable.

## Core Focus Areas

* **E-commerce Process Automation**
  Automating product listing, variation management, media workflows, and operational controls at scale.

* **Python Automation & Scripting**
  Batch processing, file & data pipelines, validation layers, and fault-tolerant scripts.

* **Data Validation & Quality Controls**
  Detecting inconsistent, missing, or malformed data using Python and SQL-based verification mechanisms.

* **QA-Oriented Development**
  Applying test design techniques (boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, regression logic) directly into automation systems.

* **Operational Scalability**
  Designing systems capable of processing tens of thousands of records daily with predictable behavior.

## Selected Projects (Representative)

> Repositories below are designed to demonstrate **real operational problems**, not toy examples.

* **E-commerce Automation Pipeline**
  Python-based system for product data ingestion, image validation, variation control, and batch publishing workflows.

* **Data Validation & Consistency Checker**
  SQL + Python utilities to detect data integrity issues, missing fields, and logical inconsistencies in operational datasets.

* **QA-Aware Automation Utilities**
  Automation scripts written with explicit validation rules, fail-fast logic, and test-oriented structure.

---

## Technical Stack

* **Languages:** Python, SQL (MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL)
* **Automation:** Batch processing, pipeline design, validation layers
* **Testing & QA:** SDLC / STLC, Functional & Regression Testing, Test Design Techniques
* **Tools:** Jira, TestRail, Zephyr
* **Domains:** E-commerce operations, automation systems, data quality

---

## Professional Approach

I value **clarity, validation, and sustainability** over short-term speed.

Automation is not just about writing scripts — it is about designing systems that:

* detect errors early,
* reduce operational risk,
* and remain understandable months later.
